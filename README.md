this project is the the first practicum's project
this project is about music preferences in simple analysis

In this project, we will compare the music preferences of users in the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville. we will study actual Y.Music data to test the hypotheses below and compare user behavior in these two cities.

we will testing three hypotheses:
1. User activity varies depending on the day and city.
2. On Monday mornings, residents of Springfield and Shelbyville tune in to different genres. This also applies on Friday nights.
3. Listeners in Springfield and Shelbyville have different preferences. In Springfield, users prefer pop music, while in Shelbyville rap music has more fans.
 
This project will consist of three phases:
  1. Data Overview
  2. Pre-processing of Data
  3. Hypothesis testing

conclusions:
  We have tested the following three hypotheses:

1. User activity in Springfield and Shelbyville depends on the day of the week, although these two cities vary in many ways.
2. On Monday mornings, residents of Springfield and Shelbyville tune in to different genres. This also applies on Friday nights.
3. Listeners in Springfield and Shelbyville have different preferences. In both Springfield and Shelbyville, they preferred pop music.

After analyzing the available data, we can conclude that:

1. User activity in Springfield and Shelbyville depends on the day, even if the city is different.

The first hypothesis can be fully accepted.

2. Musical preferences did not vary significantly throughout the week in Springfield and Shelbyville. We can see a small difference in the order on Monday, but:
* In both Springfield and Shelbyville, users listen to pop music the most.

Therefore, we cannot accept this hypothesis. It is also important to remember that the results obtained could have been different had we not had the missing values.
3. It turns out that the music preferences of users from Springfield and Shelbyville are very similar.

The third hypothesis is rejected. If there are indeed differences in preference, unfortunately we cannot know this from this data.
